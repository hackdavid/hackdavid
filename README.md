## Daud Ibrahim

Senior Machine Learning Engineer focused on building and operating 
production-grade AI systems at scale.

I work across the full lifecycle of ML systems — from large-scale data 
pipelines and distributed training to low-latency inference services 
and backend integration — with a strong emphasis on reliability, cost 
efficiency, and real-world impact.

### Core Expertise
• Large Language Models: training, fine-tuning, alignment, and evaluation  
• Distributed systems: GPU training, high-throughput inference, scaling  
• ML systems engineering: model serving, monitoring, CI/CD, MLOps  
• Backend integration: FastAPI services, workflow automation, APIs  

### Selected Systems & Work
• Designed and deployed AI-driven retail intelligence systems used across hundreds of stores, improving on-shelf availability and operational visibility  
• Built LLM-powered analytics and assistant systems for automated business insights and decision support  
• Trained and optimized large-scale multilingual language models using distributed GPU infrastructure  
• Developed high-availability inference services supporting tens of thousands of requests per hour  
• Implemented model evaluation, benchmarking, and regression-safe comparison pipelines  
• Integrated ML models into production backend systems to automate high-volume business workflows  

*(Some systems are internal and described here at an architectural level.)*

### Technical Stack (Representative)
• ML/AI: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, LoRA, PEFT, RLHF, DPO  
• LLM Systems: Distributed training, TensorRT-LLM, vLLM, DeepSpeed, MoE  
• Backend & Infra: FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, CI/CD pipelines  
• Data & MLOps: Spark, Airflow, ETL pipelines, monitoring, model evaluation  

### Engineering Principles
• Production realism over research demos  
• Measurable impact and operational ownership  
• Clean abstractions, testability, and regression safety  
• Systems that scale in both usage and complexity  

This profile showcases selected public work and system-level experience.
