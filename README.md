## About

I build and deploy production AI systems at scale. My work spans large language model training and inference, MLOps infrastructure, and end-to-end machine learning pipelines that handle millions of requests under strict latency and cost constraints.

**Core focus areas:**
- Distributed LLM training and parameter-efficient fine-tuning
- Low-latency inference optimization (TensorRT-LLM, vLLM, custom serving)
- Multi-agent systems and retrieval-augmented generation
- Production MLOps: Docker, Kubernetes, FastAPI, cloud orchestration

I've trained billion-parameter models from scratch, optimized inference stacks to reduce latency by 25%, and shipped AI systems serving 50k+ requests per hour in retail and enterprise environments.
