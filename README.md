### 🧠 What I Work On

I design, build, and operate **applied AI systems** that move beyond experimentation into real production use.

My work spans:
- Large language models and multimodal systems
- Distributed training and inference optimization
- ML platforms integrated with backend and product workflows
- Evaluation, benchmarking, and regression-safe deployment

I am especially interested in problems where **model quality, system reliability, and cost efficiency must coexist**.
